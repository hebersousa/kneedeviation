## Abstract

Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is a degenerative disease of the cartilage, which affects
especially the elderly, and can cause pain, joint deformity, bone loss and consequently the
functional reduction of the lower limbs. It is known that the malalignment of the lower
limbs, in addition to other factors, is associated with the genesis of knee OA by causing
an asymmetric load distribution on the knees. Thus, the measurement of malalignment
of the lower limbs, by physical evaluation or through radiographic exams, is essential for
planning surgery to correct the lower limb deviation. Taking into account the relationship
of the radiographic examination with the exposure of patients to ionizing radiation, the
additional cost involved, and in the case of the clinical examination, subjectivity and
dependence on the specialist’s experience, it becomes interesting to investigate alternative
technologies for measuring the anatomical deviation of the lower limbs. This work explores
the use of Augmented Reality as a tool to measure the malalignment of the lower limbs,
reducing the dependence on radiographic exams and at the same time increasing the
objectivity of the measurement through the automatic identification of the position of
the joints in the patient’s body. For this, a mobile application is developed using Apple’s
ARKit to later assess the accuracy and reproducibility of the proposed methodology.
